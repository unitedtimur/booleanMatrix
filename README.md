1. The first step is to create a variable in the file of the main with the type of BM or BV, depending on whether you need 
to create a Boolean matrix or vector.
2. In constructors of a Boolean vector or a Boolean matrix there are all possible options for initialization.
3. To initialize a Boolean vector from a string, create a string and define it in the constructor, or write it into the constructor right away.
4. To initialize the Boolean matrix, you need to allocate memory for the two-dimensional array char and pass a pointer to the array to the designer of the Boolean matrix.
